### The Problem
They buried it in plain sight.

3.5 million pages. Released to the public.  
Reading them would take 20 years.  
Investigating them? Over a century.

No journalist will touch this.  
No institution will fund this.  
The volume guarantees obscurity.

**That’s the point.**

### The Mission
We need the truth.

The Epstein case reveals how much the public has been lied to by those in power.  
Real victims. Powerless individuals whose lives were destroyed.  
They deserve justice.

This is about holding leaders accountable.  
America’s dignity depends on transparency.

**Every name. Every connection. Every lie.**  
This isn’t “trust us.”  
This is **verify it yourself**.

### Why Decentralization Matters
Centralized institutions killed stories, exposed sources, and pulled funding.  
UNREDACTED is designed to be unstoppable.

- No single point of failure  
- No CEO to pressure  
- No server to subpoena  
- Findings stored permanently on decentralized infrastructure  
- Progress verifiable on-chain  
- Code fully open source

### What We’re Building
The first AI-powered swarm that processes the entire 3.5 million pages in parallel:

- Extracts every name  
- Maps every relationship  
- Breaks every redaction  
- Verifies every claim  

Making the truth searchable, public, and permanent.

### Join the Investigation
The powerful can no longer hide behind complexity.

The public, armed with the right tools, can do what governments and media won’t.
